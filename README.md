🚀 Live Location Tracker with Node.js and Leaflet.js 🌍

I’m excited to share my latest project: a real-time location tracking application using Node.js, Socket.io, and Leaflet.js! 🗺️

Features:
Real-time Location Updates: Utilizing the Geolocation API and Socket.io, this app sends and receives live location data.
Dynamic Mapping: Integrates with Leaflet.js to display user locations on an interactive map.
User Management: Efficiently handles multiple users, updating locations and removing markers when users disconnect.

How It Works:
Geolocation Watch: The app continuously watches the user's location and sends updates to the server via WebSockets.
Real-time Map Updates: The server broadcasts location data to all connected clients, updating the map dynamically.
User Disconnection Handling: When a user disconnects, their marker is removed from the map to keep the view clean and accurate.


Technologies Used:
Node.js: Server-side JavaScript runtime.
Socket.io: For real-time, bidirectional communication.
Leaflet.js: For rendering the interactive map.
OpenStreetMap: Tile provider for the map.
